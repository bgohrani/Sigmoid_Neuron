# Sigmoid Neuron Model in Deep Learning

## Hi There!
This repo contains a Jupyter notebook named Sigmoid_Neuron, containing code for implementing and visualizing the Sigmoid function in Python. The Sigmoid is a bounded and non-linear real function that is commonly employed in Deep Learning for logistic regression tasks, since its range lies between 0 and 1. 

Notebook Outline
- Plotting the sigmoid function with 2D and 3D plots in matplotlib.
- Visualizing Squared-Error loss on toy data with 3D plots.
- Structured Class with training functions for Sigmoid Neurons, with Squared-Error and Cross-Entropy Loss function.
- Plotting and visualizing the training process on given data with animations.
- Loading and preprocessing mobile phone data to be used for training a Sigmoid neuron.
- Standardization and Binarization of the data to form a classification problem.
- Training the model, visualizing convergence and calculating accuracy.

Note: The mobile phone data used for training has also been provided in the repository.
